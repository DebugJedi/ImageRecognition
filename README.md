# ImageRecognition
In this example using the neural network I have created a model that is trained on the images of cat and dog and launched this model on the web broswer for users to upload the photos of cat and dog which the model can predict.   
Of this I have used two files of python one trains the neural network model and saves it on the desktop. Second file fetch the image uploaded throught web browser and run the processed image throught the trained model to predict the category and display the result on the browser.
